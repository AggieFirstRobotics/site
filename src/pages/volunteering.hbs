AFR mirrors Texas A&M’s core value of “selfless service”. Not only does volunteering help to better our community, we
believe in giving back to the programs that encouraged us to be where we all are today and to assist in giving the same
opportunities to younger students. AFR will continue to encourage our members to volunteer for state and regional
robotics competitions and local Bryan/College Station events, along with any new opportunities to give back, to
engineering or anything else that exemplifies both the spirit of FIRST and the TAMU Core Values.

Recognized AFR volunteering opportunities and individual service opportunities can be tracked for points within AFR.
The member with the most volunteer work will be awarded the AFR Volunteer of the Year - more information and upcoming
opportunities below.

**Believe you have a new volunteer opportunity for us?** Send us an email at {{email-link}} and we’ll get
back to you.

**AFR member with further questions or want to check your points?** {{social-link "slack" "Slack"}} PM Claire!
