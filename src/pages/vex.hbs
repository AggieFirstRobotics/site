{{#container}}
VEX U is a collegiate level robotics competition that AFR uses to learn and practice engineering at a lower-level,
undergraduate level on a low budget. It offers a traditional FIRST style challenge on a smaller scale. AFR uses VEX U
to keep people excited over science, technology, engineering and math, and to also offer undergraduates a stepping
stone to larger scale design challenges such as SAE.

Unfortunately our open applications are closed, however if you are interested in joining the waitlist we welcome you to
apply. Our waitlist is merit based so those who have applied before you have no advantage over your application. When a
position opens up on the team, you will be contacted and invited to the team. If you’re unsure about what kind of
commitments we’re looking for we invite you to come to our Friday General Build Meetings from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM on
the first floor of Zachary at the Fischer Engineering Design Center.

# Turning Point

VEX Robotics Competition Turning Point is played on a 12’x12’ square field configured as seen to the right. Two teams –
one “red” and one “blue” – composed of two robots each, compete in matches consisting of a forty-five second autonomous
period followed by seventy-five seconds of driver-controlled play.

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by High Scoring or Low Scoring Caps,
Toggling Flags, and by Alliance Parking or Center Parking Robots on the Platforms.

We plan on competing at:
 - SKILLS: Pasadena VEX U - December 15
 - SKILLS: Austin VEX U - January 19
 - TOURNAMENT: Clearlake VEX U - February 23

More competition details to come!
