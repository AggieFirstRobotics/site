This year, we are creating a team for a new robotics competition, VEX U. This program is an expanded version of the VEX
Robotics Competition that allows for more customization and flexibility. Students will gain experience in a limited
working environment and interacting with other students within our own club and on other teams. The VEX U college and
university competition has more than 300 teams competing globally.

Applications will open towards the beginning of the fall semester for all A&M students.
